INSTALLATION
Jast copy folder with plugin to rutorrent/plugins.
If you want to use 'Delete with data', you also need to install 'erasedata' plugin.

CONFIG
As it only beta auto detect of mobile device turned off. To enable it edit 'init.js' file. In first line change 'plugin.enableAutodetect = false;' to 'plugin.enableAutodetect = true;'.
If in rutorrent you turned off 'Confim when deleting' mobile version will not confim too. In this case decision about deleting data will be taken depending on the parameter 'plugin.eraseWithDataDefault' (see below).

Another options:
plugin.eraseWithDataDefault - default state of delete with data checkbox. Values:
	* undefined - first unchecked. Then will save state from last select until page refresh.
	* false (default) - always unchecked by default
	* true (default) - always checked by default

USING
If you enabled autodetect plugin will automaticaly load when detecting mobile device. Another way is adding '?mobile=1' to the end of rutorrent url.
