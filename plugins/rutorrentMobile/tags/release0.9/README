INSTALLATION
Jast copy folder with plugin to rutorrent/plugins.
If you want to use 'Delete with data', you also need to install 'erasedata' plugin.
If you want to browse directories in add torrent dialog you need '_getdir' plugin.

CONFIG
By default auto detect of mobile device turned on. To disable it edit 'init.js' file. In first line change 'plugin.enableAutodetect = true;' to 'plugin.enableAutodetect = false;'.
If in rutorrent you turned off 'Confim when deleting' mobile version will not confim too. In this case decision about deleting data will be taken depending on the parameter 'plugin.eraseWithDataDefault' (see below).

Another options:
plugin.eraseWithDataDefault - default state of delete with data checkbox. Values:
	* undefined - first unchecked. Then will save state from last select until page refresh.
	* false (default) - always unchecked by default
	* true (default) - always checked by default
plugin.navBarToBottom - changed position of toolbar. If true (default) it will be on the bottom. If false - on the top.
plugin.getDirEnabled - if true (default) it will enable support of _getdir plugin.

USING
If you enabled autodetect plugin will automaticaly load when detecting mobile device. Another way is adding '?mobile=1' to the end of rutorrent url.

LOCALIZATION
For now plugin localized only on two languages: english and russian. For another languages will using english. But there are only two plugin specific string for now. Because of this I don't think that it will be big problem to use plugin on another languages.
